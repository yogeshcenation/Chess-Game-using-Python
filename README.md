The game is played in a simple windowed interface that comes with a sprites and backgrounds images. The player can play the game via Mouse, you only need to use the Left Mouse Button to move a chess piece by dragging it in a correct position such as(Pawn can move two turn forward in first move and eat enemy piece diagonally, Horse can only move in L shape position, Rook can move all the way forward, backward, left, right, Bishop can only move diagonally, Queen can move anywhere diagonally or straight, king can only move one block away).

# Built with:
1. PyCharm 2021.3.1 (Professional Edition)
2. Python 3.8

# Chess Game using Python  Installation:
1. You will have to download & install the Python IDLE's, here's the link "https://www.python.org/downloads/".
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the extracted folder
4. Locate the .py file.
5. Then open the file via python IDLE.
6. Run the gui.py file to launch the program.

If you have git, and you know how to use it, you can also clone the
repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it and the
run the gui.py directly.


# Important Message :
If you find the error message as the following (when you run gui.py) :

```python
import pygame, chessModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'
```
## So how can we fix that?
1. Open the folder where your Python is installed.
2. Open the "Scripts" folder.
3. Copy the path of the Scripts folder using the Address Bar.
4. Open Command Prompt/Terminal. 
5. Type "cd <space> <PATH_OF_SCRIPT_FOLDER_COPIED> (use right click to paste it).
4. Type `pip install pygame` and press Enter
 
 ![Command Prompt Command](https://github.com/yogeshcenation/Chess-Game-using-Python/blob/6e1fd12d8ad8b0504c97619173a61466f4a9120f/images/cmd.jpg)

5. It should Download and install the "pygame" Module to your computer.
6. Now run gui.py in the IDE. It works fine :-)


The Chess Game was created using Python programming language. I hope that this system can help you to what you are looking for. 
Enjoy Coding!!
